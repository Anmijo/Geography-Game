# Geography-Game
A web game where players guess all the countries and capitals starting with a random letter

### Project Description
This project was inspired from a game I play with my friends to waste time. We pick a random letter and then each of us has to say a country or capital that begins with that letter, we do this in rotation until we are done with all of them. This game online web game is similiar to that game in concept where you get a random letter and you are have to put all the countries and capitals that start with that letter.
